# amdwvpns
Asus-Merlin Dual WAN VPN Support tool

v1.0.0

This project is used to solve the problem that the client can't access and use the VPN server inside the router when the dual WAN port of ASUS Merlin router is connected to the external network.

The router VPN servers involved in this project include OpenVPN server, PPTP VPN server and IPSec VPN server.

The project script can be deployed and run in the JFFS partition of the router or the Entware environment in the USB disk.

Since the author's amdwprsct project has included all the functions of this project, in order to avoid the application running conflict, the project script can't run in the router at the same time as the author's amdwprsct project product.
